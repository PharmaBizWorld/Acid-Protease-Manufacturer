 What is Acid Protease?
Acid proteases are a type of enzyme that catalyze the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids under acidic conditions. These enzymes are crucial in various industrial applications, such as food and beverage production, detergent formulation, pharmaceuticals, leather processing, and animal feed. They are especially useful in processes that require protein hydrolysis at low pH, which makes them versatile tools in the enzyme industry.
